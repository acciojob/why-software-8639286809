    <h1>  why i want to become a developer?</h1>
<p>I want to become a software engineer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that can make people's lives easier. The idea that I can write code to automate tasks, build useful applications, or even contribute to global platforms is exciting and fulfilling. Iâ€™m fascinated by how technology can impact education, health, business, and communication, and I want to be a part of that transformation.</p>	<script type="text/javascript" src="./script.js">
